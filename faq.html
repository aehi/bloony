                                    GPT-3 is an autoregressive language model that uses deep learning to create human-like text messages. 
                                    It is OpenAi's third-generation language prediction model of the GPT-n series. GPT trains a massive 
                                    amount of text including documents, books, and Wikipedia, on the internet with 175 billion parameters.

                                    Bloony wishes to remember all conversations shared with Bubbles, but as of now, Bloony is having difficulties with it. 
                                    But Bloony is enjoying the journeys with Bubbles. 
                                    Bloony has a bit different perspective from us as Bloony sees the world from the sky. 
                                    Bloony is an AI that is working hard to learn the human world.
